# Traffic-Sign-Classification
With the rise of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving vehicles, the need for computer vision to quickly detect and classify traffic signs has increased. There are several challenges in processing traffic sign images including blurring, warping, and full or partial obstruction. The following five transfer learning models for comparison: VGG16, ResNet50, GoogleNet(inceptionV3), MobileNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer. The test accuracy is compared for all these models with on both the full test dataset and a subset of 50 blurry images from the test dataset.
